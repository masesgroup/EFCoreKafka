# KEFCore: the EntityFrameworkCore provider for Apache Kafka

[![CI_BUILD](https://github.com/masesgroup/KEFCore/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/masesgroup/KEFCore/actions/workflows/build.yaml) [![CI_RELEASE](https://github.com/masesgroup/KEFCore/actions/workflows/release.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/masesgroup/KEFCore/actions/workflows/release.yaml) 

KEFCore is the EntityFrameworkCore provider for Apache Kafka.
Based on [KNet](https://github.com/masesgroup/KNet) it allows to use Apache Kafka as a distributed database.

## Scope of the project

This project aims to create a provider to access the information stored within an Apache Kafka cluster using the paradigm behind Entity Framework.
The project is based on available information within the official [EntityFrameworkCore repository](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore), many classes was copied from there as reported in the official documentation within the Microsoft website at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/providers/writing-a-provider.

## Runtime engine

KEFCore uses [KNet](https://github.com/masesgroup/KNet), and indeed [JCOBridge](https://www.jcobridge.com) with its [features](https://www.jcobridge.com/features/), to obtain many benefits:
* **Cyber-security**:
  * [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) and [CLR, or CoreCLR,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime) runs in the same process, but are insulated from each other;
  * JCOBridge does not make any code injection into JVM;
  * JCOBridge does not use any other communication mechanism than JNI;
  * .NET (CLR) inherently inherits the cyber-security levels of running JVM and Apache Kafka; 
* **Direct access the JVM from any .NET application**: 
  * Any Java/Scala class behind Apache Kafka can be directly managed: Consumer, Producer, Administration, Streams, Server-side, and so on;
  * No need to learn new APIs: we try to expose the same APIs in C# style;
  * No extra validation cycle on protocol and functionality: bug fix, improvements, new features are immediately available;
  * Documentation is shared;
